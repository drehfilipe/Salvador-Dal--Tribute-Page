# Responsive Web Design Projects - Tribute Page

## Salvador Dal√≠ Tribute Page

This is my first coding project and part of my portfolio using freeCodeCamp lessons.
A great challenge and harder than I expected it! Got started with html/CSS basics using what I learned with freeCodeCamp. Also explored flex grids, id and classes elements and responsiveness.
